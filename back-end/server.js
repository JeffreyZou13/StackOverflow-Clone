  /*
    * made db on an open stack instance
    * connection doesn't work yet, even tho i added the the rule, enabled mongo on the firewall, and changed the config file
    * ip is: 130.245.171.174
    * I think the string isn't formatted correctly cuz for remote dbs, it's formatted like..
    * mongodb://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]
    * too lazy to fix now lmaoo
